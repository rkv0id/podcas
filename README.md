# Podcas: Podcast Search and Recommendation Engine

This repository comprises two separate packages.<br>
`podcas` is a flexible library that lets users explore podcasts datasets with some specific schema requirements (to be added later).<br>
`podcas-api` is a FastAPI service that exposes `podcas` search capabilities under simple endpoints. It also provides a caching layer to avoid duplicate computation.

Please checkout both packages `README`s.
